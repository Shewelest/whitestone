literally something which is "of itself", i.e. metadata -- "the data of data"

The meta problem; an abstract arithmetic example using an arbitrary function..

Let meta(x) be 'the doubling function', and x be any integer or discrete quality; therefore, meta(x) = 2x by declaration (see ASCRIPTION).

meta(meta(x)) = meta(2x) by substitution.

meta(2x) = 2(2x) = 4x by multiplication.

Now, let 4x = 3 by declaration.

x = 3/4 by dividing both sides of the equation by 4.

Since x is an integer, the last declaration has created a contradiction in terms.

Therefore, meta(meta(x)) cannot equal 3 in any circumstance given our initial constraints meant to reflect the course of reality.

In other words, there is an objective (linguistic, at least, most notably) gap created when when incursively ascribing something more than twice. For meta-example, 'metametaphysics' -- also called "pataphysics" -- the word, stictly speaking, does not and cannot refer to 'the physics of physics of physics' if we were to substitute the quality of physics for x. This means in any strict or discrete element environment 'the physics of physics of physics' would require special linguistic or variable (pointer) assignment or demarcation as it cannot be functionally generated by *any normal computation*.
