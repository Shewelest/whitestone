CAVEATS:

The 'zeroth' trivium subject, in the modernized liberal sense; presupposes any grammar, see META for an example.

Logic is not always the first, greatest or most potent point to begin from; but, it is an ideal vantage point, arguable the most reliable.

** Extraneous means that which is irrelevant or moot to the formulation or calculative process; as such, this does not necessarily include vacuous truths.
